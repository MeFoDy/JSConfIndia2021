# How to stop choosing JavaScript frameworks and start living

Imagine, you have a task to hang a picture on the wall. What would you do first? You can start by picking up your favorite tool. Let's say, a hammer. If you're a Senior HammerJS Developer, you could probably use a hammer for screws as well as for nails. Or you could spend some time researching if you need that picture on that particular wall in the beginning.

The same goes for the frontend development. JavaScript framework is just a tool that helps us to build applications. And like any other tool, it has its purpose and the list of tasks it's good for. So why is it so hard to choose the right one for a new project? In the talk, Sasha is going to share her experience on how to choose the best tools for your projects and what important things you have to decide before you start looking at your options.
